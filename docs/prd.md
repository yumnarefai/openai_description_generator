## Original Requirements
The boss wants an application that can take a file path as input, which is an OpenAPI specification in .yaml format. The application should extract necessary information from the specification to generate descriptions for the resources defined in it. The descriptions should be generated using OpenAI ChatGPT. Once the descriptions are generated, they should be used to update the OpenAPI specification. The updated specification should be stored in the same folder as the original specification, with the prefix 'updated_'.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create an application that can read and extract information from OpenAPI specifications in .yaml format",
    "Generate descriptions for the resources defined in the specification using OpenAI ChatGPT",
    "Update the original OpenAPI specification with the generated descriptions and save it in the same folder with the prefix 'updated_'"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to input the file path of an OpenAPI specification in .yaml format into the application",
    "As a user, I want the application to extract necessary information from the specification",
    "As a user, I want the application to generate descriptions for the resources defined in the specification using OpenAI ChatGPT",
    "As a user, I want the application to update the original specification with the generated descriptions",
    "As a user, I want the updated specification to be saved in the same folder as the original, with the prefix 'updated_'"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Swagger UI: An open-source tool for visualizing and testing OpenAPI specifications. However, it does not generate descriptions or update specifications.",
    "Postman: A popular API client that supports OpenAPI specifications. It can generate collections from specifications but does not generate descriptions or update specifications.",
    "Apimatic: A tool that can transform OpenAPI specifications into SDKs, but it does not generate descriptions or update specifications.",
    "Stoplight: A platform for designing, documenting, and testing APIs. It supports OpenAPI specifications but does not generate descriptions or update specifications.",
    "ReDoc: An open-source tool for generating API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. It does not update specifications.",
    "Swagger Inspector: A tool for testing and auto-generating OpenAPI documentation. However, it does not update specifications."

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be an application that can read OpenAPI specifications in .yaml format, extract necessary information, generate descriptions for the resources using OpenAI ChatGPT, update the original specification with the generated descriptions, and save the updated specification in the same folder with the prefix 'updated_'.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("The application should accept a file path as input", "P0"),
    ("The application should read and extract information from OpenAPI specifications in .yaml format", "P0"),
    ("The application should generate descriptions for the resources using OpenAI ChatGPT", "P0"),
    ("The application should update the original specification with the generated descriptions", "P0"),
    ("The application should save the updated specification in the same folder with the prefix 'updated_'", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The application should have a simple and intuitive interface. It should have a text field for the user to input the file path of the OpenAPI specification. There should be a 'Generate Descriptions' button that the user can click to start the process. Once the process is complete, a notification should appear informing the user that the updated specification has been saved in the same folder as the original.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
