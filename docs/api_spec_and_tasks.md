## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. It uses the other modules to parse the OpenAPI specification, generate descriptions, and update the specification."),
    ("openapi_parser.py", "Contains the OpenAPIParser class that is responsible for parsing the OpenAPI specification and extracting the resources."),
    ("description_generator.py", "Contains the DescriptionGenerator class that is responsible for generating descriptions for the resources using the GPT-3 model."),
    ("openapi_updater.py", "Contains the OpenAPIUpdater class that is responsible for updating the OpenAPI specification with the generated descriptions and saving the updated specification.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "openapi_parser.py",
    "description_generator.py",
    "openapi_updater.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'openapi_parser.py' contains the OpenAPIParser class that uses the PyYAML package to read the OpenAPI specification from a YAML file. It has a 'parse' method that takes a file path as input and stores the parsed specification in the 'openapi_spec' attribute. It also has an 'extract_resources' method that extracts the resources from the 'openapi_spec' attribute.

The 'description_generator.py' contains the DescriptionGenerator class that uses the OpenAI package to generate descriptions for the resources. It has a 'generate_description' method that takes a resource as input and returns a description for the resource.

The 'openapi_updater.py' contains the OpenAPIUpdater class that uses the PyYAML package to update the OpenAPI specification with the generated descriptions and save the updated specification to a YAML file. It has an 'update_specification' method that takes a dictionary of resources with descriptions as input and updates the 'openapi_spec' attribute. It also has a 'save_updated_specification' method that takes a file path as input and saves the 'openapi_spec' attribute to the file.

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, we need to ensure that we have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the specified paths. We also need to handle any potential errors that may occur during the parsing, generation, and updating processes.
